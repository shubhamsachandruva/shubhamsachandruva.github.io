Check the following to understand more about the fio and why we should use it before making any conclusion for the disk or application performance.

In python we can see multiple ways of running the same piece of code depends on how it is being written and which of the following ( Asyncio / MultiThreading / MultiProcessing / Sync ) is being used.
As an experiment i have written a very small IO bound code and have implemented Asyncio / MultiThreading / MultiProcessing / Sync one by another see the performance.</description></item><item><title>Perfmon-aws-ec2: Missing Perf Counters/Metrics</title><link>http://shubhamsachan.github.io/blogs/perfmon-ec2/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Mar 2021 17:52:35 +0530</pubDate><guid>http://shubhamsachan.github.io/blogs/perfmon-ec2/</guid><description>How-to-resolve-missing-Perf-Counters-Metrics-from-PerfMon-in-EC2-Windows-AWS While working on aws windows ec2 instance, i have observed that, sometimes, not all the perfmon perf Counters/metrics are available, and error appear when perfmon starts as in below image. click to see more</description></item></channel></rss>
