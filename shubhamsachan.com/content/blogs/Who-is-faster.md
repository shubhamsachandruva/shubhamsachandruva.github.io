As a curious performance engineer we always want to find out the fastest method and implement/advise the same to get the maximum performance.

In python we can see multiple ways of running the same piece of code depends on how it is being written and which of the following ( Asyncio / MultiThreading / MultiProcessing / Sync ) is being used.

As an experiment i have written a very small IO bound code and have implemented Asyncio / MultiThreading / MultiProcessing / Sync one by another see the performance.[click to see more](https://www.notion.so/Who-is-faster-Asyncio-MultiThreading-MultiProcessing-Sync-in-Python-9acff1203fa74c3981141aab5fb0dcca)
